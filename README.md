# energy_equation_hvps

In this Mathematic notebook called aer_equil we present the basic theory of the energy balance equation of particle grains immersed in a plasma medium. 

The equations are solved using physical parameters consistent with the conditions found on a plasma torch of the High Velocity Plasma Spray kind.

For more information on the physical motivation for the problem, wait for the paper "Temperature Measurement by Optical Emission Spectroscopy of the Plasma Jet Produced by a High Velociy Plasma Spray (HVPS)", to be published.
