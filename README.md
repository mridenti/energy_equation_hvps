# energy_equation_hvps

In this Mathematica notebook called aer_equil.nb we present the basic theory of the energy balance equation of particle grains immersed in a plasma medium. It was run and tested in Mathematica 10.0 . 

The equations are solved using physical parameters that are consistent with the conditions found on a High Velocity Plasma Spray (HVPS) plasma torch (Journal of Materials Processing Technology, v. 237, p. 351-360, 2016). 

For more information on the physical motivation of this problem, wait for the paper "Temperature Measurement by Optical Emission Spectroscopy of the Plasma Jet Produced by a High Velociy Plasma Spray (HVPS)", to be published soon.
